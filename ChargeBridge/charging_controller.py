"""Orchestrator for charging sessions.

central.py coordinates the high-level flow while delegating OCPP
communication and meter handling to dedicated modules.  This layout keeps
responsibilities separated and makes the system easier to extend for other
charging networks.  The demo focuses on Gresgying 120–180 kW DC chargers
but the code paths remain compatible with other vendors and OCPP versions.
